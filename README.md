# Fruit Bat Adventure
Fruit Bat Adventure, a Touhou-inspired bullet hell shoot-em-up written in Godot. This project was made as part of a private game jam.

Made with help of the GodotBulletHellper plugin, which can be found here: https://github.com/mavsm/GodotBulletHellper 

This game runs a slightly modified version of said plugin, which is included in the files here.

Godot engine can also be found here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot


Sprites, animations, artwork, music, and sfx are all made by me.
All the programming (with the exception of Godot and BulletHellper) was also done by me, using Godot's docs and forums as references.

This is my first real project, so the code may be messy and inefficient. There are a lot of inconsistencies with variable usage, which should hopefully be fixed in the final release. Comments will be added later on. 

# The game
Fruit bat girl is enjoying the lovely sunny day when she finds out that all her apples were stolen. Being hungry, she sets off to find her apples and comes across a horde of owls led by Owl girl. Help Fruit bat girl get all her apples back in this difficult bullet hell shoot-em-up! Currently there is only one stage planned. An additional one maybe added later on if there is enough time.
